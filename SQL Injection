SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection, mostly referred to as SQLi, is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed. When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that hasn't been properly validated, there runs the potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete or alter private and customer data and also attack the web applications authentication methods to private or customer areas. This is why as well as SQLi being one of the oldest web application vulnerabilities, it also can be the most damaging.

In this room, you'll learn what databases are, what SQL is with some basic SQL commands, how to detect SQL vulnerabilities, how to exploit SQLi vulnerabilities and as a developer how you can protect yourself against SQL Injection.
